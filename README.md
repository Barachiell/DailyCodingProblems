# Daily Coding Problems

I've been having fun while sharpening my problem-solving skills by tackling daily coding challenges from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/. This repository documents my solutions, tracks my progress, and aims to be a resource for beginner and intermediate programmers looking to practice with daily coding challenges.

**How it's Organized**

1. The problems are organized by categories, each folder representing a problem category (e.g., Algorithms, Data Structures).
2. Inside each category folder, there are subfolders named by date (e.g., May_02_2024).
3. Each day's subfolder contains the problem statement (text file or document) and your solution code.
